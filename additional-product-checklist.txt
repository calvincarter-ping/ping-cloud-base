This file is meant to encompass any additional changes required when adding new products to PingCloud.

Logs
Log files leave the docker container at a container level granularity. This means all logs within a given container
are stored within a single log from the perspective of FluentD. In order to again filter the logs back to an individual
log file granularity to be processed by FluentD, a regex must be created to match each filename. This must be done within
insights.yaml for each new product following the existing patterns in place.
