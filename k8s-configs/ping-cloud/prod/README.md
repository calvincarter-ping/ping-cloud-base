# Prod Specific PingCloud configurations

Any configurations that exist in this directory or any of its child directories are only applicable for `prod` (stage/prod) deployments.

Directories are broken down between `common` configurations which are shared amongst all `prod` deployments and configurations that are dynamic depending on the deployment size.
