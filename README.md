# Ping Cloud Base

You'll find here all of the base Kubernetes (K8s) configuration files that can be used to quickly deploy Ping Cloud software stacks to a Kubernetes cluster for evaluation, testing, and demonstration purposes. Currently only Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters are supported.

> **Caution**: The K8s configuration files are under active development and are not stable for production purposes.

See [Build the K8s environment](docs/buildEnvironment.md) for initial setup information.
