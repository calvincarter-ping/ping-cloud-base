# when the unit tests run, the shell can't resolve the path to the script and so it exits
# immediately with a 'command not found' error before the test can finish.  Attempts to isolate
# the call in a util script and mock around via in the test didn't work.  The hacky workaround
# is to assign the full command to an alias and then mock the alias in the test.
